    "The line first, second = float('-inf'), float('-inf') initializes two variables, first and second, to negative infinity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down why this is done and what it means.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "1. Negative Infinity: \n",
    "float('-inf') represents negative infinity in Python. It is a special floating-point value that is less than any other numeric value. Using float('-inf') ensures that any number compared to it will be larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Initialization: \n",
    "By initializing first and second to negative infinity, you ensure that any number in the list will replace these initial values. This is especially useful when trying to find the largest and second largest numbers in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Use Negative Infinity?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Comparison Guarantee: \n",
    "When you start with first and second set to negative infinity, the first two numbers you encounter in the list will automatically become the largest (first) and second largest (second), as any number is greater than negative infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Edge Cases Handling: \n",
    "Using negative infinity allows your algorithm to handle lists that contain negative numbers properly. If you initialized first and second to 0, the function might fail with lists that only contain negative numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Instead of asking for 10 integers one by one, the user inputs all integers at once, separated by spaces. This is more efficient for both the user and the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "elements = list(map(int, input(\"Enter 10 integers for the list, separated by spaces: \").split()))\n",
    "\n",
    "This line reads the input, splits it by spaces, and maps each part to an integer, creating a list of integers."

    "1. Using a Set for Fast Lookups:\n",
    "\n",
    "A set is used to keep track of elements that have already been encountered.\n",
    "Sets provide average O(1) time complexity for lookups and insertions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. List Comprehension for Concise Filtering:\n",
    "\n",
    "The list comprehension iterates over each element in the original list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The condition x not in seen and not seen.add(x) ensures that:\n",
    "\n",
    "x not in seen checks if the element x has already been encountered.\n",
    "not seen.add(x) adds the element x to the set seen and returns False. Since and short-circuits, this ensures that x is added to the resulting list only if it was not already in seen.\n",

    "3. Preserves Original Order:\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of elements is preserved because the list comprehension iterates over the original list in order.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "The list comprehension iterates over each element exactly once: O(n).\n",
    "Set lookups and insertions both have an average time complexity of O(1).\n",
    "Overall time complexity: O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "The additional space used is proportional to the number of unique elements: O(u), where u is the number of unique elements in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall space complexity: O(n) in the worst case, where all elements are unique.\n",
    "This implementation strikes a balance between efficiency and simplicity, making it both fast and easy to understand."
